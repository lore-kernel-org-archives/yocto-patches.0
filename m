As noted in the README.security file, pseudo is not intended for
secure computing, but to assist in build system workflows.

During review the recent rewrite_proc_fd_ref it was noted that
the way pseudo is working may be counter to the way selinux and
similar tools are expecting the system to behave.  This behavior
change is acceptable for the build environment workflow, but
is not acceptable to a running/server workflow.

See the README.security file for more details.

(cherry picked from commit 019e93e03f7bb4fe2bacf3658f7dd6bf0d23fb65)

Changes from the cherry-picked version, to match this branch:

Section 1: mention DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES, as this branch still has the
Darwin port, and note that the port is known not to work and is
unlikely to be useful (see b550fd3, which removes it on master).

Section 3: drop the /proc/self/fd/<n> and /dev/fd/<n> item, as
rewrite_proc_fd_ref() (fcd8a81) is not on this branch.  fchmodat calls
the real fchmodat(), not chmod, and mknodat is implemented by
ports/linux/guts/__xmknodat.c, as the Linux guts override ports/unix;
both corrections were made upstream in 81d4150 and dd69ed1.

+pseudo -- security considerations
+
+SUMMARY:
+
+pseudo is a build tool.  It exists so that ordinary users can produce
+packages and filesystem images containing files that appear to be owned
+by root, device nodes, special permissions and extended attributes.
+
+pseudo is NOT a security boundary and must not be used in security
+sensitive applications.  In particular, do not use pseudo:
+
+* to contain, confine or sandbox untrusted programs;
+* as a substitute for real privileges, a real chroot, a container or a
+  virtual machine;
+* to process filesystem trees that untrusted or concurrent processes can
+  modify while pseudo is running;
+* as the only guarantee that the ownership, permissions, SELinux labels
+  or file capabilities in a security critical image are correct.
+
+
+1. INTERCEPTION IS COOPERATIVE
+
+pseudo works by loading libpseudo with LD_PRELOAD (DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
+on Darwin) and wrapping libc functions.  Anything that does not go
+through those wrappers reaches the real filesystem directly, with the
+real privileges of the user who started pseudo.  This includes:
+
+* statically linked programs;
+* programs that make system calls directly, including language runtimes
+  that do not use libc for file operations, and interfaces such as
+  io_uring;
+* setuid/setgid programs, for which the dynamic linker ignores
+  LD_PRELOAD;
+* any program that clears LD_PRELOAD, or that sets PSEUDO_UNLOAD or
+  PSEUDO_DISABLED (see pseudo_client.c), both of which are deliberately
+  supported ways to turn pseudo off.
+
+A program running under pseudo can therefore always step outside of it.
+pseudo cannot be used to restrict what a program does.
+
+The Darwin port is described as implemented, but it has not worked for
+a long time: System Integrity Protection and the hardened runtime block
+DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES, so it is unlikely to be useful.
+
+
+2. "ROOT" EXISTS ONLY IN THE DATABASE
+
+pseudo grants no privileges.  Files on disk remain owned by the real
+user, and the ownership and modes that programs see under pseudo are
+read back from pseudo's database.  The kernel does not enforce any of
+the emulated ownership or permissions.
+
+The real on-disk modes are also deliberately different from the
+emulated ones.  PSEUDO_FS_MODE (pseudo_client.h) always adds owner read
+and write permission (and owner execute for directories) so that the
+emulated root can access everything, and removes group/other write,
+setuid and setgid bits from the real file.  A file that is meant to be
+mode 0600 or 0000 and owned by root, for example /etc/shadow or a
+private key, is readable and writable on disk by the build user and by
+any process running as that user, whether or not it is under pseudo.
+
+Treat everything pseudo writes as accessible to the build user.
+
+
+3. FILE DESCRIPTORS BECOME PATHS (TOCTOU)
+
+Many security sensitive programs rely on the kernel resolving a file
+descriptor, or a path relative to a directory descriptor, to a specific
+inode.  This is how they avoid races where a path component is replaced
+with a symlink between checking a file and using it.  pseudo removes
+that protection in several ways:
+
+* Paths are canonicalized in user space.  pseudo_fix_path()
+  (pseudo_util.c) walks each path component with lstat() and readlink()
+  and builds an absolute path, and the real function is then called
+  with that absolute path (see doc/chroot).  A call such as
+  openat(dirfd, "file", ...) is no longer anchored to dirfd; it becomes
+  an operation on "<recorded path of dirfd>/file".  Kernel guarantees
+  such as O_NOFOLLOW on intermediate components or RESOLVE_BENEATH are
+  not reproduced by this resolution, except in the few wrappers marked
+  preserve_paths in wrapfuncs.in, which handle paths themselves.
+
+* The path pseudo recorded for a descriptor (fd_path() in
+  pseudo_client.c) is used to resolve paths relative to it.  That
+  record can be stale: the file or directory may have been renamed, or
+  the descriptor may have been inherited, received over a socket, or
+  opened by a call pseudo did not see.
+
+* Several wrappers check a path and then act on it by path in a second
+  step.  For example, fchmodat (ports/unix/guts/fchmodat.c) stats the
+  path and later calls the real fchmodat() on the same path, and mknodat
+  (ports/linux/guts/__xmknodat.c) removes the path again by name if the
+  database update fails.
+
+If anything else can change the tree while pseudo is working on it, an
+operation may be applied to a different file than the one that was
+checked, both in pseudo's database and on the real filesystem.  Only
+run pseudo on trees that are fully under the control of the build.
+
+
+4. THE CHROOT IS EMULATED
+
+pseudo's chroot() support only prepends a stored prefix to absolute
+paths and strips it from some results (see doc/chroot).  No real
+chroot() is performed, and the README notes the support is incomplete.
+Any of the bypasses in section 1, or any path pseudo resolves
+differently from the kernel, reaches the host filesystem.  pseudo's
+chroot must not be relied on to keep a program inside a directory.
+
+
+5. METADATA LIVES IN A DATABASE THAT CAN DRIFT
+
+Emulated ownership, modes, device nodes and extended attributes,
+including security.selinux and security.capability, exist only in
+pseudo's database until a packaging or image step copies them out.
+Entries are keyed by path and inode number.  When files are changed
+outside of pseudo, for example deleted or recreated without pseudo
+loaded, an inode number can be reused and the database can attach the
+old file's ownership, mode or attributes to a new file.  The server
+reports such cases as "inode mismatch" or "path mismatch" (pseudo.c),
+but cannot always know which side is correct.
+
+Accesses to paths listed in PSEUDO_IGNORE_PATHS are deliberately not
+tracked at all.
+
+Generated images should be verified independently if their ownership,
+permissions, labels or capabilities matter for security.  Do not
+ignore mismatch errors in pseudo's log.
+
+
+6. THE SERVER TRUSTS ITS CLIENTS
+
+The pseudo server listens on a Unix socket in its local state directory
+and does not authenticate clients beyond the filesystem permissions of
+that socket.  Any process running as the build user can connect and
+change the database, and the database files themselves are writable by
+that user.  The resulting metadata can only be trusted as much as every
+process running as the build user.
+
+
+RECOMMENDATIONS:
+
+* Run pseudo only on build output that is private to the build and is
+  not modified concurrently by anything outside of it.
+* Run untrusted build steps under a real isolation mechanism (a
+  container, a virtual machine, or a dedicated user), with pseudo inside
+  it if needed, never pseudo alone.
+* Do not store secrets in a pseudo-managed tree on a shared system;
+  they are readable by the build user regardless of their emulated
+  ownership and mode.
+* Verify the ownership, permissions, labels and capabilities of
+  security relevant files in the final image.
